<p>This repository includes the notebook file for my data analysis report on airline passenger satisfaction data. My curiosity on this topic stemmed from the fact that
  I wanted to understand what made an airline a 'good airline.' For example,
  which factors contribute most strongly to the 'World's Best Airline Report?' How do they decide the order of the rankings?
  In order to answer these questions, I aimed to understand which factors contribute most to whether or not a customer is 
satisfied with an airline, and whether customers are more likely to have positive, negative, or neutral sentiments towards airlines based on the data. The dataset I used was found on Kaggle, 
and has 103904 entries. <a href ='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mysarahmadbhat/airline-passenger-satisfaction'> Link to the full dataset </a></p>
